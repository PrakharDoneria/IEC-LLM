Message From Group Dean Academics
Dear Friends,
On behalf of the faculty members, staff, and fellow students, I am pleased to welcome you to the IEC Group of Institutions. When you made IEC Group of Institutions your college of choice, you took the first step in ensuring your place among the illustrious sons and daughters of this great institution. When you chose to study in the IEC Group of Institutions, you made your first major investment decision.
We live in challenging times, the pressure of career demands, and the need to balance our professional and personal lives, choosing what is best to continue our education and which higher education institution is best suited to our needs matters more than ever. As Group Dean Academics of IEC Group of Institutions, I am privileged to lead a dedicated and talented group of educators who are committed to helping you down this path.
Thousands of years ago, the Indian Rishis propounded three fundamental principles of human knowledge: ""Lead me from Falsehood to Truth"" (asato ma sad gamaya); ""Lead me from Darkness to Light"" (tamaso ma jyotir gamaya); and ""Lead me from Mortality to Immortality"" (mrityor ma amritam gamaya). Keeping this in mind IEC Group of Institutions has been working to offer practical learning modules, imparting the right value system, realistic approach, and teamwork and coaction that build competencies and enable the executive trainees to take on the competition effectively and achieve excellence in their career.
We, at the IEC Group of Institutions, concentrate on providing theoretical knowledge coupled with a lot of practical exposure. We also emphasize developing analytical & communication skills, creativity, leadership, and innovation to make our executive graduates capable of undertaking responsibilities. Value-added courses have been made a regular feature of our system to fulfill today's demands of the corporate world. These efforts go a long way in making the executive graduates desirable and employable.
The present crisis in environment, energy, population growth, and sustainability of the human species can only be solved through this convergence of technologies. It is agreed in the research communities that the IT age will be followed by the Nano age, be followed by Cogno, and the real Space age. Being a country of 1.3 billion population and still growing, India’s contribution to the progress of Science and Technology has been very limited in the last two centuries. Off late, we are becoming a country of “Service” engineers, doctors, and managers and at the same time have geared up to use the technology created and developed by others. Though it’s a globalized world, only contributors are remembered and revered. Einsteins, Ramans, Mendels, Faradays, etc will be there as long as the human species live on earth and how many Indians are there in any Science or Technology books or laws? The problems of this country can only be solved by making technology cost-effective and indigenous. And this can happen only if our education system which has become a factory producing literate, English-speaking laborers starts revamping itself towards quality research and giving freedom to young minds to imagine and dream. Hands-on experience with creativity ably footed with the right theory and skills sets are requirements of the time. Young Indian students should come into research to take this country back to the glory where Science and Technology prospered 5000 years ago. This is the core of the IEC Group of Institutions, the Centre of Excellence for Advanced Education and Research which has been taking a small step toward quality education.
I invite you to become better acquainted with the IEC Group of Institutions, where you will discover not only engineering excellence, but also a campus alive with round-the-clock cultural, artistic, and intellectual activity.
Welcome to the IEC Group of Institutions. We look forward to helping you achieve your goals.
With best wishes,
- Prof. (Dr.) B. Sharan

Industrial Visit To NTPC At DADRI
IEC Group of institution organised an industrial visit to NTPC(National Thermal power Corporation)at Dadri Greater Noida, Utter Pradesh on 23rd April,2019. Twenty five students of EE/EC branch had visited NTPC. NTPC provides many job opportunities and internship program for engineering students.

NTPC is a power project to meet the power demand of national capital region (India). NTPC has huge coal fired thermal power plant, a gasfired plant and green and clean energy solar plant. Capacity of these plant are 1820 MW, 830 MW And 5 MW respectively.

Thermal power plant

First of all we have visited the thermal power plant. First unit of thermal power plant is installed in October 1991. Capacity of this unit is 210 MW. And further 1992, 1993 and 1994 installed three different unit of thermal power plant each unit capacity is 210 MW. In order to meet the growing electricity demand, two unit is installed in 2010, a unit with capacity is 490 MW. Total capacity of thermal power plant is 1820 MW.

In this plant coal is used as fuel source to increase the temperature of water, which is converted into high pressure steam. High pressure steam is projected on turbine blades to rotate the turbine. Shaft of the turbine and generator are mechanically connected to each other. The connected synchronous generator hence generates AC voltage.

Temperature of super heated steam is maintained around 500 °C. To convert the residual steam into water, cooling towers were used.


Gas power plant

LPG and air is used as a fuel in the gas power plant. Using combustion process, mixture of air and gas passes in the turbine, which rotate the generator connected to its shaft. Further, the energy of exhaust gases is reused to generated steam. This steam is used in steam turbine to generate additional electricity. The combined cycle plant is normally designed to meet base and intermediate load.

Gas power plant is used to supply electricity to peak load. The first unit of gas power plant is installed in March 1992. Capacity of this unit is 130 MW. At present time total 6 units are working. 4 units of 130 MW and 2 unit of 154 MW comprising of total capacity 830 MW.


Solar power plant

INTRODUCTION
A vehicle is a hybrid if it utilizes more than one form of onboard energy to achieve propulsion. In practice, that means a hybrid will have a traditional internal-combustion engine and a fuel tank, as well as one or more electric motors and a battery pack.
The objective of this project was to design, simulate, analyse and then fabricate a racing vehicle intended for sale to the non-professional racing enthusiasts. The vehicle should be aerodynamically designed, economic, safe and single seat high performance vehicle. Ergonomics and safety have been an integral part of our design strategy and anthropometric data has been used. Special focus will be put on human safety, the ease of mass production of the vehicle. Almost all the vehicle subsystems will be designed and fabricated by the team indigenously. The vehicle has been fabricated meticulously by the team, using state-of-the-art facilities, comprehensively satisfying both the design goals and manufacturing constraints.

Summary Of Sports Meet Session-3
IEC College 325 Views 10th January 2024
IEC College of Engineering and Technology, Gr.Noida organised “IEC Premier league sports Meet session-3 in the college premises on its beautiful lush green Cricket Ground. The premier league started on 26th December2024 with great enthusiasm and high spirit. The institution organised Cricket tournament for boys and Kho-Kho, the traditional game for girls, in which 32 boy’s schools and 16 girls’ schools across the region participated in the league.
WAccording to the fixture all the matches were in knock-out mode. The students who participated in the matches showcased their true talents and sportsmanship throughout the entire league. Sports give us the platform to build character and foster positive values as well as boost the confidence to face real life challenges.
In Kho-Kho, girls showcased their unmatched potential during all the matches and gave phenomenal performances that made the Spectators thrilled. Spectators also cheered up for their beasties. Some players were really extra-ordinary and showed beautiful moves, drives and running during the matches.
Apart from Kh-Kho, in cricket all the matches remained low- scoring in this IEC premier league as the pitch favoured the bowlers. In this tournament, bowlers took 4 times hat tricks as conditions were favourable for them especially fast bowlers. In this league highest individual’s score was 93 and 6 wickets were also taken by a bowler in a match that was a record. Longest six of 93 meter was also recorded in this league.
The league ended on a positive note and the credit goes to the entire officiating team for making this league a successful one. Special thanks goes to the ground staff who prepared the beautiful and state of the art lush green playground in a short span of time.
We are also indebted to the management of IEC that organised such a phenomenal tournament with high spirit.

Message From Group Dean Academics
Dear Friends,
On behalf of the faculty members, staff, and fellow students, I am pleased to welcome you to the IEC Group of Institutions. When you made IEC Group of Institutions your college of choice, you took the first step in ensuring your place among the illustrious sons and daughters of this great institution. When you chose to study in the IEC Group of Institutions, you made your first major investment decision.
We live in challenging times, the pressure of career demands, and the need to balance our professional and personal lives, choosing what is best to continue our education and which higher education institution is best suited to our needs matters more than ever. As Group Dean Academics of IEC Group of Institutions, I am privileged to lead a dedicated and talented group of educators who are committed to helping you down this path.
Thousands of years ago, the Indian Rishis propounded three fundamental principles of human knowledge: ""Lead me from Falsehood to Truth"" (asato ma sad gamaya); ""Lead me from Darkness to Light"" (tamaso ma jyotir gamaya); and ""Lead me from Mortality to Immortality"" (mrityor ma amritam gamaya). Keeping this in mind IEC Group of Institutions has been working to offer practical learning modules, imparting the right value system, realistic approach, and teamwork and coaction that build competencies and enable the executive trainees to take on the competition effectively and achieve excellence in their career.
We, at the IEC Group of Institutions, concentrate on providing theoretical knowledge coupled with a lot of practical exposure. We also emphasize developing analytical & communication skills, creativity, leadership, and innovation to make our executive graduates capable of undertaking responsibilities. Value-added courses have been made a regular feature of our system to fulfill today's demands of the corporate world. These efforts go a long way in making the executive graduates desirable and employable.
The present crisis in environment, energy, population growth, and sustainability of the human species can only be solved through this convergence of technologies. It is agreed in the research communities that the IT age will be followed by the Nano age, be followed by Cogno, and the real Space age. Being a country of 1.3 billion population and still growing, India’s contribution to the progress of Science and Technology has been very limited in the last two centuries. Off late, we are becoming a country of “Service” engineers, doctors, and managers and at the same time have geared up to use the technology created and developed by others. Though it’s a globalized world, only contributors are remembered and revered. Einsteins, Ramans, Mendels, Faradays, etc will be there as long as the human species live on earth and how many Indians are there in any Science or Technology books or laws? The problems of this country can only be solved by making technology cost-effective and indigenous. And this can happen only if our education system which has become a factory producing literate, English-speaking laborers starts revamping itself towards quality research and giving freedom to young minds to imagine and dream. Hands-on experience with creativity ably footed with the right theory and skills sets are requirements of the time. Young Indian students should come into research to take this country back to the glory where Science and Technology prospered 5000 years ago. This is the core of the IEC Group of Institutions, the Centre of Excellence for Advanced Education and Research which has been taking a small step toward quality education.
I invite you to become better acquainted with the IEC Group of Institutions, where you will discover not only engineering excellence, but also a campus alive with round-the-clock cultural, artistic, and intellectual activity.
Welcome to the IEC Group of Institutions. We look forward to helping you achieve your goals.
With best wishes,
- Prof. (Dr.) B. Sharan

Industrial Visit
Industrial Visit To NTPC At DADRI
IEC Group of institution organised an industrial visit to NTPC(National Thermal power Corporation)at Dadri Greater Noida, Utter Pradesh on 23rd April,2019. Twenty five students of EE/EC branch had visited NTPC. NTPC provides many job opportunities and internship program for engineering students.

NTPC is a power project to meet the power demand of national capital region (India). NTPC has huge coal fired thermal power plant, a gasfired plant and green and clean energy solar plant. Capacity of these plant are 1820 MW, 830 MW And 5 MW respectively.

Thermal power plant

First of all we have visited the thermal power plant. First unit of thermal power plant is installed in October 1991. Capacity of this unit is 210 MW. And further 1992, 1993 and 1994 installed three different unit of thermal power plant each unit capacity is 210 MW. In order to meet the growing electricity demand, two unit is installed in 2010, a unit with capacity is 490 MW. Total capacity of thermal power plant is 1820 MW.

In this plant coal is used as fuel source to increase the temperature of water, which is converted into high pressure steam. High pressure steam is projected on turbine blades to rotate the turbine. Shaft of the turbine and generator are mechanically connected to each other. The connected synchronous generator hence generates AC voltage.

Temperature of super heated steam is maintained around 500 °C. To convert the residual steam into water, cooling towers were used.


Gas power plant

LPG and air is used as a fuel in the gas power plant. Using combustion process, mixture of air and gas passes in the turbine, which rotate the generator connected to its shaft. Further, the energy of exhaust gases is reused to generated steam. This steam is used in steam turbine to generate additional electricity. The combined cycle plant is normally designed to meet base and intermediate load.

Gas power plant is used to supply electricity to peak load. The first unit of gas power plant is installed in March 1992. Capacity of this unit is 130 MW. At present time total 6 units are working. 4 units of 130 MW and 2 unit of 154 MW comprising of total capacity 830 MW.


Solar power plant

Solar power plant is a source of green and clean energy. Solar panel consists of photo-voltaic cell. Photo-voltaic cell directly converts solar energy into electricity. They work on the principle of photovoltaic effect. The solar panel generates DC voltage. DC voltage is then converted into AC voltage using multi-level-inverter. Step-up transformer further increase voltage to transmit.

Solar power plant was started in 2013 there. It generate 5 MW power covering an area of 27 acer.

Automatic robots were also employed to clean dust of solar panel on regular basis.

INTRODUCTION
A vehicle is a hybrid if it utilizes more than one form of onboard energy to achieve propulsion. In practice, that means a hybrid will have a traditional internal-combustion engine and a fuel tank, as well as one or more electric motors and a battery pack.
The objective of this project was to design, simulate, analyse and then fabricate a racing vehicle intended for sale to the non-professional racing enthusiasts. The vehicle should be aerodynamically designed, economic, safe and single seat high performance vehicle. Ergonomics and safety have been an integral part of our design strategy and anthropometric data has been used. Special focus will be put on human safety, the ease of mass production of the vehicle. Almost all the vehicle subsystems will be designed and fabricated by the team indigenously. The vehicle has been fabricated meticulously by the team, using state-of-the-art facilities, comprehensively satisfying both the design goals and manufacturing constraints.

Summary Of Sports Meet Session-3
IEC College 325 Views 10th January 2024
IEC College of Engineering and Technology, Gr.Noida organised “IEC Premier league sports Meet session-3 in the college premises on its beautiful lush green Cricket Ground. The premier league started on 26th December2024 with great enthusiasm and high spirit. The institution organised Cricket tournament for boys and Kho-Kho, the traditional game for girls, in which 32 boy’s schools and 16 girls’ schools across the region participated in the league.
WAccording to the fixture all the matches were in knock-out mode. The students who participated in the matches showcased their true talents and sportsmanship throughout the entire league. Sports give us the platform to build character and foster positive values as well as boost the confidence to face real life challenges.
In Kho-Kho, girls showcased their unmatched potential during all the matches and gave phenomenal performances that made the Spectators thrilled. Spectators also cheered up for their beasties. Some players were really extra-ordinary and showed beautiful moves, drives and running during the matches.
Apart from Kh-Kho, in cricket all the matches remained low- scoring in this IEC premier league as the pitch favoured the bowlers. In this tournament, bowlers took 4 times hat tricks as conditions were favourable for them especially fast bowlers. In this league highest individual’s score was 93 and 6 wickets were also taken by a bowler in a match that was a record. Longest six of 93 meter was also recorded in this league.
The league ended on a positive note and the credit goes to the entire officiating team for making this league a successful one. Special thanks goes to the ground staff who prepared the beautiful and state of the art lush green playground in a short span of time.
We are also indebted to the management of IEC that organised such a phenomenal tournament with high spirit.

Description
We have been dedicated to providing a comprehensive education that emphasizes strong theoretical foundations alongside practical applications aligned with the latest advancements in computer technology. Our program is designed to equip students with the knowledge and skills required to excel in the dynamic field of computer applications. The curriculum includes a blend of theoretical courses and hands-on, application-oriented learning experiences. In the final semester, students have the opportunity to showcase their learning through practical activities, dedicating the entire term to project work. We take pride in fostering an intellectual environment that nurtures individual talents, allowing our students to emerge as well-rounded professionals. Our faculty is actively engaged in enhancing their teaching and research standards by attending and conducting conferences, seminars, symposiums, orientation programs, and Faculty Development Programs (FDPs).
The dedication of our MCA students is evident in the high-quality project work they produce during their final semester. A notable achievement is the 'Smart Mirror,' a product developed by four MCA students in collaboration with our on-campus R&D Cell. Our alumni have secured placements in renowned companies such as WIPRO, HCL Tech, Accenture, Nagarro, Google. A distinctive feature of our Department is the active involvement of senior students in mentoring and guiding their juniors. This interaction facilitates holistic development, including preparation for training and placement opportunities in various industries. The collaborative spirit is further embodied by the Departmental Society, named Aakruti, established in 2021. This society organizes programming labs, events, and other activities to enrich the overall learning experience for our students. As we continue to evolve, our commitment remains unwavering — to provide an environment that nurtures creativity, fosters innovation, and prepares our students to meet the challenges of the ever-evolving field of computer applications.

Description
We have been dedicated to providing a comprehensive education that emphasizes strong theoretical foundations alongside practical applications aligned with the latest advancements in computer technology. Our program is designed to equip students with the knowledge and skills required to excel in the dynamic field of computer applications. The curriculum includes a blend of theoretical courses and hands-on, application-oriented learning experiences. In the final semester, students have the opportunity to showcase their learning through practical activities, dedicating the entire term to project work. We take pride in fostering an intellectual environment that nurtures individual talents, allowing our students to emerge as well-rounded professionals. Our faculty is actively engaged in enhancing their teaching and research standards by attending and conducting conferences, seminars, symposiums, orientation programs, and Faculty Development Programs (FDPs).
The dedication of our MCA students is evident in the high-quality project work they produce during their final semester. A notable achievement is the 'Smart Mirror,' a product developed by four MCA students in collaboration with our on-campus R&D Cell. Our alumni have secured placements in renowned companies such as WIPRO, HCL Tech, Accenture, Nagarro, Google. A distinctive feature of our Department is the active involvement of senior students in mentoring and guiding their juniors. This interaction facilitates holistic development, including preparation for training and placement opportunities in various industries. The collaborative spirit is further embodied by the Departmental Society, named Aakruti, established in 2021. This society organizes programming labs, events, and other activities to enrich the overall learning experience for our students. As we continue to evolve, our commitment remains unwavering — to provide an environment that nurtures creativity, fosters innovation, and prepares our students to meet the challenges of the ever-evolving field of computer applications.
